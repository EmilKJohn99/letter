    My Love sheethal,

    <p>
    Its been bumpy and i have only put an effort when it came to the last straw but from the bottom of my heart the only thing i have for you is love.
    I have been waiting for you,yearning for you all this while i have been here. Eventhough the dreams i saw were horrible the only thing i could think of was cuddling with you because when you are there i feel so safe.
    I love watching you eat and that little happy dance you do when you get your food,it just melts my heart,not to mention how steaming sexy you look on all of our dates, its too bad that  we have never had sex after our dates.
    Sheethal it would be an understatement to say i care about you, literally i feel you,miss you ,breathe you every second, that scent of yours when you stand next to me,its like welcome back home sort of feel. 
    Looking back at those pictures the only thing i could think of was how made for each other we look, there has been many downs with us but nothing will change the way i feel for you,the love never goes away.
    The comfort i feel when i am with you is a whole other thing, i think you feel the same way for me, everytime you sleep before i do i feel so special because you felt so safe sleeping with me. 
    And when you sleep you look like an angel like i can just keep looking at that angelic face of yours.   
 </p>
    
<p>
    You are the light of my loneliness<br>
    Love of my heart<br>
    Dew of my desert<br>
    Tone of my song<br>
    The queen of my kingdom<br>
    And I LOVE YOUUU
    </p>
    <div class="signature">
        Forever yours,<br>
        Emil ❤️
